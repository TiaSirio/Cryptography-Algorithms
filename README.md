# Cryptographic Projects in Excel VBA 🔐

## Overview 🌐

This repository features four cryptographic projects implemented as Excel VBA macros, each showcasing a different cryptographic algorithm for specific cryptographic operations.

## Cryptographic Algorithms Implemented 🛡️

1. **Modular Power Elevation without Overflow**
   - Calculates a large number raised to a large power modulo another large number without overflowing intermediate calculations.

2. **Prime Numbers**
   - Checks whether a given number is prime or not.

3. **Euclid Extended**
   - Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
   - Computes coefficients for Bezout's identity, useful for solving linear Diophantine equations.

4. **Baby Step Giant Step**
   - Solves the discrete logarithm problem, a fundamental challenge in cryptography.

## University Course 📖

This is the final project of the exam "Crittografia" for the Computer Science and Engineering degree at Polytechnic of Milano.
