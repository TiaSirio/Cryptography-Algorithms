# Cryptographic Projects in Excel VBA

## Introduction

This repository contains four small cryptographic projects implemented as Excel VBA macros. Each project implements a different cryptographic algorithm and can be used to perform a specific cryptographic operation. The four algorithms implemented are:

## Modular Power Elevation without Overflow

This algorithm is used to calculate the value of a large number raised to a large power modulo another large number, without overflowing the intermediate calculations.

## Prime Numbers

This algorithm is used to check whether a given number is prime or not.

## Euclid Extended

This algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and also to compute the coefficients of Bezout's identity, which are used in solving linear Diophantine equations.

## Baby Step Giant Step

This algorithm is used to solve the discrete logarithm problem, which is a fundamental problem in cryptography.
